This Python script uses the OpenCV library to process video files. It starts by reading a video named sample.mp4, extracting each frame, and reversing their order. Additionally, the script resizes each frame to 50% of its original size for efficient storage. The reversed and resized frames are then saved into a new video file called reversed.avi. The script also provides progress updates while processing every 100 frames. This project showcases how to manipulate videos in Python, making it a practical tool for anyone looking to learn video processing techniques using OpenCV
